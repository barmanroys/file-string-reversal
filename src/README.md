### Goal
This small problem popped up on my newsfeed, from an [interview process](https://quantiqpartners.zapier.app/software-developer-experienced) and thought I would take a shot at it with a few different languages. Will add other languages depending on my bandwith. 

### Problem 
> Write a program in C++ that takes in a file as input and reverses every line and puts it in a different file. Try to do this with as little memory footprint as possible and as fast as possible.

### Solution Approaches

#### C++
In the spirit of the original requirement, keeping it all in the same file.
